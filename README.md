Project Description : 
      To combine all the emergency services at one platform. i.e Ambulance, Police, Fire Brigade etc.
      In our society most of the people dont know what to do in panic conditions.
      For Example:
          In some cases user don't have choice what to do in FIRE threating scenarios except calling Ambulance, so as per aspect of this             matter we design a platform where user will be able to call Emergency Services and our represntaive will handle that request and           inform that departemnt.
